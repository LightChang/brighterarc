用系統服務，輸出結合智慧科技之整合性綠能系統方案；同時以沙崙科學城建構綠能創新沙盒，營造新創生態系。(3)在人才培訓部分，引領綠領人才升級，建立綠能產業人才訓練中心，並結合產學合作，培養具系統整合能量及國際綠色金融人才。(4)在融資制度部分，健全參與綠電制度，完善躉購制度與憑證市場切換機制，以及建構友善綠電交易平臺；並建立國家綠能融資，保證制度等綠色金融支援體系。(5)在貿易輸出部分，以國家隊共榮亞洲綠能市場，透過金融市場資金及保證機制等，支援綠能產業；並以臺灣經驗協助發展海外客製化綠能方案，加強海外綠能亮點經驗行銷。二、關於國民年金老年基本保證年金宜適當調整問題：(一)為考量近年來物價明顯上漲，以及加強照顧領取「國民年金法」（以下簡稱本法）各項給付之弱勢民眾基本生活，爰經100年12月21日總統令公布增訂本法第54條之1規定：「自中華民國一百零一年一月一日起，本法所定老年年金給付加計金額、老年基本保證年金、第四十二條第二項與第四項及第五十三條所定金額，調整為新臺幣三千五百元，身心障礙年金給付基本保障及身心障礙基本保證年金之金額，調整為新臺幣四千七百元；其後每四年調整一次，由中央主管機關參照中央主計機關發布之最近一年消費者物價指數較前次調整之前一年消費者物價指數成長率公告調整之，但成長率為零或負數時，不予調整」。據此，藉由以上隨消費者物價指數定期調整年金給付之機制，以確保年金給付之實質購買力。(二)另依據本法施行細則第58條之1規定：「本法第五十四條之一所稱最近一年消費者物價指數，指每四年檢討調整給付金額當年，中央主計機關所公布之前一年一月至十二月為止十二個月之平均消費者物價指數，並計算至二位小數，以下四捨五入。」基此，本法老年基本保證年金等相關給付除已於101年度定額調增外，並分別於105年度依100年至104年間消費者物價指數（CPI）成長率3.65%，以及109年度依104年至108年間CPI成長率3.97%依法調整給付金額。下次預計將於113年度依108年至112年間CPI成長率進行調整（成長率為0或負數時，不予調整），以確保年金給付因應消費者物價指數成長後之實質購買力，並確保領取本法各項給付之民眾，其基本生活能持續獲得合理且妥善之照顧。(三)有關委員關切之消費者物價指數成長率由109年底-0.23%上升至本年9月份之2.29%（應為2.62%）及適時檢討提高老年基本保證年金金額等節，近2年因疫情影響國內外經濟，致物價短期微幅波動成長，衛福部將賡續關注消費者物價指數成長情形，並依本法相關調整機制適時提高老年基本保證年金等各項年金給付金額，以落實本法照顧經濟弱勢民眾之目的。三、關於甲種風景區未建築土地，應視其被限制強度及房地合一稅之立法精神，檢討排除其適用房地合一稅問題：(一)我國自105年1月1日起實施房地合一稅制，其立法目的旨在改善修法前房屋及土地分開課稅之缺失，並抑制不動產短期投機炒作，健全不動產市場發展，爰將房屋、土地交易所得合一按實價課徵所得稅，俾落實所得稅制度「有所得即須課稅」之原則。按「所得稅法」第4條之4第1項規定，個人及營利事業交易105年1月1日以後取得之「房屋」、「房屋及其坐落基地」或「依法得核發建造執照之土地」之交易所得，應依房地合一稅制規定課徵所得稅，以建立合理、透明稅制，促使房屋、土地交易正常化。又考量部分土地性質特殊，例如配合政府農業政策或為鼓勵民間配合政府推動之土地開發及徵收等政策，爰於「所得稅法」第4條之5第1項第2款至第4款規定，符合「農業發展條例」第37條及第38條之1規定得申請不課徵土地增值稅之土地、被徵收或被徵收前先行協議價購之土地及其土地改良物，以及尚未被徵收前移轉依「都市計畫法」指定之公共設施保留地，得免納所得稅。(二)按新北市政府核定自109年11月10日起實施之變更新店水源特定區計畫（土地使用分區管制要點第二次通盤檢討）內容略以，「甲種風景區範圍內土地以維護自然景觀、涵養保育天然資源為主，其土地使用應依下列規定：1.本區內土地經本府核准得為下列使用：(7)原有合法建築物之修建、改建、增建。……」是以，該計畫內之甲種風景區之土地倘具有得依相關法令規定申請核發建造執照之資格，係屬上開「所得稅法」第4條之4第1項規定所稱之「依法得核發建造執照之土地」。(三)有關甲種風景區土地究是否屬於房地合一稅制之課稅範圍，事涉個案土地使用分區管制條件、該土地得否核發建造執照等事宜，涉建築法規及建築主管機關之認定，爰宜就個案事實認定。","docUrl":"https://lci.ly.gov.tw/LyLCEW/communique1/work/111/34/LCIDC01_1113401_00006.doc","baseId":"9e9fb0af-7596-7e51-666c-54aa938be098","isChunked":true,"chunkIndex":1,"totalChunks":3,"chunkText":"（一）行政院函送吳委員秉叡就第10屆第4會期施政質詢之書面答復，請查照案。\n\n財團法人中華民國證券櫃檯買賣中心於本年4月29日公告並施行「永續發展債券作業要點」，截至本年10月21日累計已發行72檔綠色債券，合計發行總額約1921億元；7檔社會責任債券，合計發行總額約142億元；11檔可持續發展債券，合計發行總額約560億元。(3)強化綠色及永續金融人才培育：為協助金融業瞭解綠能產業特性，據以評估風險控管及審核機制，進而提高投融資及承保意願，以及開發綠色及永續金融商品，金管會持續透過周邊研訓單位辦理相關課程，培育綠色及永續金融人才，並請周邊研訓單位瞭解金融機構推動永續金融時在人才方面最需要之知能或技術，據以增加實務面及國際最新永續發展趨勢課程內容，並依不同級別屬性人員開設課程。(4)促進綠色及永續金融商品或服務發展：A.截至本年8月底止，國內投信事業已發行33檔有關ESG、永續、公司治理及綠色等相關主題之基金，合計規模約1427億元。B.目前已有13家產險公司參與離岸風電相關保險，統計107至本年第2季底累計保費收入約49億元。另產險業者已開發約21品項商業型農業保險，自104年開辦至本年第2季底累計保費收入約6.5億元。(5)強化企業ESG相關資訊揭露：A.上市櫃公司方面：a.擴大規範實收資本額20億元以上未滿50億元之上市櫃公司應編製申報永續報告書，預計112年編製111年度永續報告書時適用。b.研擬修訂年報附表、增訂參考範例及揭露指引，以引導公司揭露較為重要之環境及社會議題，例如揭露碳排放、用水量、廢棄物等量化資訊，以及職業安全、職場多元化與平等等內容，已於本年10月5日進行法規預告。c.參酌國際準則研議訂定參考範例及揭露指引，俾引導公司建立完整之氣候變遷影響評估架構及提升資訊品質，預計112年編製111年度永續報告書時適用。B.金融業方面：金管會已研擬本國銀行及保險業氣候風險財務揭露指引，預計本年底前發布，銀行及保險業首次揭露期限為112年6月底。(五)有關碳權交易所之設立時機是否成熟及相關配套措施有無按照定時程進行方面：1.我國溫管法施行至今，法律規範已完成相關綱領方案，溫室氣體排放趨勢逐漸趨緩，以國際間最常用於比較之能源燃燒所排放二氧化碳之數據來看，依國際能源總署（IEA）統計資料，以2005年為基期，近14年來我國年平均成長率約為0.1%，優於中國（4.4%）、韓國及新加坡（同為1.8%）等鄰近亞洲國家。2.行政院環保署與地方政府共同推動「低碳永續家園評等推動計畫」，執行生態綠化、綠能節電、綠色運輸、資源循環、低碳生活與永續經營等6大面向、計38項低碳行動或措施，並由村里、鄉鎮市區及直轄市、縣（市）等3層級分別推動，以提升民眾因應氣候變遷認知，落實節能減碳行動。統計至本年10月，村里層級計有1084村里取得認證，其中83個村里獲得銀級評等、1001村里獲得銅級認證評等；鄉（鎮市區）層級計有139個取得認證，其中18個鄉（鎮市區）獲得銀級評等、121個鄉（鎮市區）獲得銅級評等，直轄市、縣（市）層級則已全數取得認證，其中15個直轄市、縣（市）取得銀級評等、7個直轄市、縣（市）取得銅級評等。統計109年銅、銀級村里住宅類人均年用電量為1696度，約為全國人均年用電量1969度之86%。3.行政院環保署目前已推動自願減量抵換專案制度，配合排放交易制度之推動，已建置「溫室氣體減量抵換資訊平臺」，公開已註冊通過之計畫書、所核發減量額度及減量額度轉移紀錄等相關資訊，以強化減量額度交易機制；該平臺已具備提供納管對象及自願減量機制下採行減量措施者交流減量額度供需資訊之基本功能。4.為完備碳定價機制，於溫管法修正草案中新增徵收碳費相關規定，結合碳費及自願減量機制，規範執行自願減量計畫經審核取得之減量額度可用於抵減碳費，未來將持續強化「溫室氣體減量抵換資訊平臺」功能，擴大鼓勵自願減量，藉由多元規範以促進達成減碳目標。(六)有關2025年打造臺灣成為亞太綠能中心之目標是否能達成方面：1.為達成能源轉型目標，政府以積極節能、多元創能、智慧儲能、靈活調度及健全市場為推動策略，維持未來電力供應穩定並兼顧提高能源自主、減碳減污等多重目標；同時將轉型視為綠能產業發展契機，使臺灣成為亞太綠能中心。2.以內需市場練兵，帶動相關本土綠能產業發展與強化本土供應鏈，打造臺灣成為亞太綠能發展中心。茲說明如下：(1)在能源設置部分，發展綠能多元複合運用，結合智慧資通訊技術發展創新綠能應用模式，達成2025年太陽光電20GW及風力發電6.5GW設置，同時於2026年至2035年間離岸風電區塊開發每年1.5GW。(2)在產業發展部分，強化綠能產業能量，推動港埠風電專區，建立次世代離岸風力機關鍵零組件本土化開發能力，成為亞太離岸風電產業樞紐；並強化複合運用系統服務，輸出結合智慧科技之整合性綠能系統方案；同時以沙崙科學城建構綠能創新沙盒，營造新創生態系。(3)在人才培訓部分，引領綠領人才升級，建立綠能產業人才訓練中心，並結合產學合作，培養具系統整合能量及國際綠色金融人才。(4)在融資制度部分，健全參與綠電制度，完善躉購制度與憑證市場切換機制，以及建構友善綠電交易平臺；並建立國家綠能融資，保證制度等綠色金融支援體系。(5)在貿易輸出部分，以國家隊共榮亞洲綠能市場，透過金融市場資金及保證機制等，支援綠能產業；並以臺灣經驗協助發展海外客製化綠能方案，加強海外綠能亮點經驗行銷。二、關於國民年金老年基本保證年金宜適當調整問題：(一)為考量近年來物價明顯上漲，以及加強照顧領取「國民年金法」（以下簡稱本法）各項給付之弱勢民眾基本生活，爰經100年12月21日總統令公布增訂本法第54條之1規定：「自中華民國一百零一年一月一日起，本法所定老年年金給付加計金額、老年基本保證年金、第四十二條第二項與第四項及第五十三條所定金額，調整為新臺幣三千五百元，身心障礙年金給付基本保障及身心障礙基本保證年金之金額，調整為新臺幣四千七百元；其後每四年調整一次，由中央主管機關參照中央主計機關發布之最近一年消費者物價指數較前次調整之前一年消費者物價指數成長率公告調整之，但成長率為零或負數時，不予調整」。據此，藉由以上隨消費者物價指數定期調整年金給付之機制，以確保年金給付之實質購買力。(二)另依據本法施行細則第58條之1規定：「本法第五十四條之一所稱最近一年消費者物價指數，指每四年檢討調整給付金額當年，中央主計機關所公布之前一年一月至十二月為止十二個月之平均消費者物價指數，並計算至二位小數，以下四捨五入。」基此，本法老年基本保證年金等相關給付除已於101年度定額調增外，並分別於105年度依100年至104年間消費者物價指數（CPI）成長率3.65%，以及109年度依104年至108年間CPI成長率3.97%依法調整給付金額。下次預計將於113年度依108年至112年間CPI成長率進行調整（成長率為0或負數時，不予調整），以確保年金給付因應消費者物價指數成長後之實質購買力，並確保領取本法各項給付之民眾，其基本生活能持續獲得合理且妥善之照顧。(三)有關委員關切之消費者物價指數成長率由109年底-0.23%上升至本年9月份之2.29%（應為2.62%）及適時檢討提高老年基本保證年金金額等節，近2年因疫情影響國內外經濟，致物價短期微幅波動成長，衛福部將賡續關注消費者物價指數成長情形，並依本法相關調整機制適時提高老年基本保證年金等各項年金給付金額，以落實本法照顧經濟弱勢民眾之目的。三、關於甲種風景區未建築土地，應視其被限制強度及房地合一稅之立法精神，檢討排除其適用房地合一稅問題：(一)我國自105年1月1日起實施房地合一稅制，其立法目的旨在改善修法前房屋及土地分開課稅之缺失，並抑制不動產短期投機炒作，健全不動產市場發展，爰將房屋、土地交易所得合一按實價課徵所得稅，俾落實所得稅制度「有所得即須課稅」之原則。按「所得稅法」第4條之4第1項規定，個人及營利事業交易105年1月1日以後取得之「房屋」、「房屋及其坐落基地」或「依法得核發建造執照之土地」之交易所得，應依房地合一稅制規定課徵所得稅，以建立合理、透明稅制，促使房屋、土地交易正常化。又考量部分土地性質特殊，例如配合政府農業政策或為鼓勵民間配合政府推動之土地開發及徵收等政策，爰於「所得稅法」第4條之5第1項第2款至第4款規定，符合「農業發展條例」第37條及第38條之1規定得申請不課徵土地增值稅之土地、被徵收或被徵收前先行協議價購之土地及其土地改良物，以及尚未被徵收前移轉依「都市計畫法」指定之公共設施保留地，得免納所得稅。(二)按新北市政府核定自109年11月10日起實施之變更新店水源特定區計畫（土地使用分區管制要點第二次通盤檢討）內容略以，「甲種風景區範圍內土地以維護自然景觀、涵養保育天然資源為主，其土地使用應依下列規定：1.本區內土地經本府核准得為下列使用：(7)原有合法建築物之修建、改建、增建。……」是以，該計畫內之甲種風景區之土地倘具有得依相關法令規定申請核發建造執照之資格，係屬上開「所得稅法」第4條之4第1項規定所稱之「依法得核發建造執照之土地」。(三)有關甲種風景區土地究是否屬於房地合一稅制之課稅範圍，事涉個案土地使用分區管制條件、該土地得否核發建造執照等事宜，涉建築法規及建築主管機關之認定，爰宜就個案事實認定。"}}

用系統服務，輸出結合智慧科技之整合性綠能系統方案；同時以沙崙科學城建構綠能創新沙盒，營造新創生態系。(3)在人才培訓部分，引領綠領人才升級，建立綠能產業人才訓練中心，並結合產學合作，培養具系統整合能量及國際綠色金融人才。(4)在融資制度部分，健全參與綠電制度，完善躉購制度與憑證市場切換機制，以及建構友善綠電交易平臺；並建立國家綠能融資，保證制度等綠色金融支援體系。(5)在貿易輸出部分，以國家隊共榮亞洲綠能市場，透過金融市場資金及保證機制等，支援綠能產業；並以臺灣經驗協助發展海外客製化綠能方案，加強海外綠能亮點經驗行銷。二、關於國民年金老年基本保證年金宜適當調整問題：(一)為考量近年來物價明顯上漲，以及加強照顧領取「國民年金法」（以下簡稱本法）各項給付之弱勢民眾基本生活，爰經100年12月21日總統令公布增訂本法第54條之1規定：「自中華民國一百零一年一月一日起，本法所定老年年金給付加計金額、老年基本保證年金、第四十二條第二項與第四項及第五十三條所定金額，調整為新臺幣三千五百元，身心障礙年金給付基本保障及身心障礙基本保證年金之金額，調整為新臺幣四千七百元；其後每四年調整一次，由中央主管機關參照中央主計機關發布之最近一年消費者物價指數較前次調整之前一年消費者物價指數成長率公告調整之，但成長率為零或負數時，不予調整」。據此，藉由以上隨消費者物價指數定期調整年金給付之機制，以確保年金給付之實質購買力。(二)另依據本法施行細則第58條之1規定：「本法第五十四條之一所稱最近一年消費者物價指數，指每四年檢討調整給付金額當年，中央主計機關所公布之前一年一月至十二月為止十二個月之平均消費者物價指數，並計算至二位小數，以下四捨五入。」基此，本法老年基本保證年金等相關給付除已於101年度定額調增外，並分別於105年度依100年至104年間消費者物價指數（CPI）成長率3.65%，以及109年度依104年至108年間CPI成長率3.97%依法調整給付金額。下次預計將於113年度依108年至112年間CPI成長率進行調整（成長率為0或負數時，不予調整），以確保年金給付因應消費者物價指數成長後之實質購買力，並確保領取本法各項給付之民眾，其基本生活能持續獲得合理且妥善之照顧。(三)有關委員關切之消費者物價指數成長率由109年底-0.23%上升至本年9月份之2.29%（應為2.62%）及適時檢討提高老年基本保證年金金額等節，近2年因疫情影響國內外經濟，致物價短期微幅波動成長，衛福部將賡續關注消費者物價指數成長情形，並依本法相關調整機制適時提高老年基本保證年金等各項年金給付金額，以落實本法照顧經濟弱勢民眾之目的。三、關於甲種風景區未建築土地，應視其被限制強度及房地合一稅之立法精神，檢討排除其適用房地合一稅問題：(一)我國自105年1月1日起實施房地合一稅制，其立法目的旨在改善修法前房屋及土地分開課稅之缺失，並抑制不動產短期投機炒作，健全不動產市場發展，爰將房屋、土地交易所得合一按實價課徵所得稅，俾落實所得稅制度「有所得即須課稅」之原則。按「所得稅法」第4條之4第1項規定，個人及營利事業交易105年1月1日以後取得之「房屋」、「房屋及其坐落基地」或「依法得核發建造執照之土地」之交易所得，應依房地合一稅制規定課徵所得稅，以建立合理、透明稅制，促使房屋、土地交易正常化。又考量部分土地性質特殊，例如配合政府農業政策或為鼓勵民間配合政府推動之土地開發及徵收等政策，爰於「所得稅法」第4條之5第1項第2款至第4款規定，符合「農業發展條例」第37條及第38條之1規定得申請不課徵土地增值稅之土地、被徵收或被徵收前先行協議價購之土地及其土地改良物，以及尚未被徵收前移轉依「都市計畫法」指定之公共設施保留地，得免納所得稅。(二)按新北市政府核定自109年11月10日起實施之變更新店水源特定區計畫（土地使用分區管制要點第二次通盤檢討）內容略以，「甲種風景區範圍內土地以維護自然景觀、涵養保育天然資源為主，其土地使用應依下列規定：1.本區內土地經本府核准得為下列使用：(7)原有合法建築物之修建、改建、增建。……」是以，該計畫內之甲種風景區之土地倘具有得依相關法令規定申請核發建造執照之資格，係屬上開「所得稅法」第4條之4第1項規定所稱之「依法得核發建造執照之土地」。(三)有關甲種風景區土地究是否屬於房地合一稅制之課稅範圍，事涉個案土地使用分區管制條件、該土地得否核發建造執照等事宜，涉建築法規及建築主管機關之認定，爰宜就個案事實認定。","docUrl":"https://lci.ly.gov.tw/LyLCEW/communique1/work/111/34/LCIDC01_1113401_00006.doc","baseId":"9e9fb0af-7596-7e51-666c-54aa938be098","isChunked":true,"chunkIndex":2,"totalChunks":3,"chunkText":"（一）行政院函送吳委員秉叡就第10屆第4會期施政質詢之書面答復，請查照案。\n\n土地、被徵收或被徵收前先行協議價購之土地及其土地改良物，以及尚未被徵收前移轉依「都市計畫法」指定之公共設施保留地，得免納所得稅。(二)按新北市政府核定自109年11月10日起實施之變更新店水源特定區計畫（土地使用分區管制要點第二次通盤檢討）內容略以，「甲種風景區範圍內土地以維護自然景觀、涵養保育天然資源為主，其土地使用應依下列規定：1.本區內土地經本府核准得為下列使用：(7)原有合法建築物之修建、改建、增建。……」是以，該計畫內之甲種風景區之土地倘具有得依相關法令規定申請核發建造執照之資格，係屬上開「所得稅法」第4條之4第1項規定所稱之「依法得核發建造執照之土地」。(三)有關甲種風景區土地究是否屬於房地合一稅制之課稅範圍，事涉個案土地使用分區管制條件、該土地得否核發建造執照等事宜，涉建築法規及建築主管機關之認定，爰宜就個案事實認定。"}}

業計畫：配合行政院「健全房地產市場方案」，將租賃所得列為重點查核項目，就持有多屋者之租賃大樓、公寓或套（雅）房加強查核。3.個人間房屋租賃所得專案查核作業計畫：財政部於本（110）年8月12日核定「個人間房屋租賃所得專案查核作業計畫」，加強查核持有多戶（10戶以上）非自住住家用房屋者之租賃所得。(三)又，預售屋成交資訊申報期限改為簽約日起30日內，係本年7月1日實價登錄2.0始推動之新措施。考量現行除新制預售屋買賣案件外，尚有舊制由不動產代銷業成交之預售屋買賣案件須於緩衝期申報。為求資訊完整正確，以上開申報期限（簽約日起30日）加上受理機關行政作業所需時間規範提供查詢期程。倘新制推動較為成熟，將續予研議縮短申報期限、作業時間及申報內容等，俾使預售屋成交資訊更為即時、透明。(四)此外，實價登錄資訊係於每月1日、11日及21日對外提供查詢。依「不動產成交案件實際資訊申報登錄及預售屋銷售資訊備查辦法」第18條、第19條及第20條規定略以，直轄市、縣（市）主管機關對於不動產買賣、租賃及預售屋案件實際資訊，須篩選去除顯異於市場正常交易價格及特殊交易之資訊並整理後，方對外提供查詢，以確保資訊正確性。目前每月3次之揭露頻率，係內政部邀集各地方政府研商後，考量人力及業務負擔所做之統一標準，以利相關資料揭露期程一致，避免查詢者混淆。二、關於推動實坪制以落實居住正義問題：(一)依「民法」規定，區分所有建物包括專有部分及共有部分（即公共設施），依法均應辦理物權登記。公設係民眾日常實際使用空間，與居住品質相關，我國將公設詳細登記，符合國人確認產權範圍之交易習慣，並可減少公設認定問題及交易糾紛。又房屋買賣價格係由市場決定，共有部分（公設）登記之多寡，僅係改變單價計算標準，房屋出售總價並不因此改變。(二)內政部民國107年至108年更新實價登錄網站，已提供民眾可自由查詢「房屋建坪單價計算」，復以「預售屋及成屋買賣定型化契約應記載及不得記載事項」亦明確規範建商於交易時應將主建物、公設等資訊分別明列，以提供完整透明之交易資訊。三、關於社宅興建速度不如預期問題：(一)內政部刻依據行政院106年核定之社會住宅興辦計畫積極推動8年20萬戶社會住宅政策，規劃以直接興建12萬戶及包租代管8萬戶民間住宅方式辦理，中期目標為109年達成直接興建4萬戶及包租代管4萬戶，合計8萬戶；長期目標預計至113年達成20萬戶社會住宅之供給量。(二)第一階段（106-109年）社會住宅直接興建4萬戶之目標已於109年底如期達成。截至本年10月底止，各地方政府及國家住宅及都市更新中心（以下簡稱住都中心）提報社會住宅興辦案件，計有6436戶、新完工1萬2341戶、興建中2萬1115戶及已決標待開工9927戶，合計4萬9819戶。(三)為規劃下一階段（110年-113年）直接興建8萬戶之目標，除地方政府將賡續推動約1.2萬戶外，內政部自107年起即於全國各縣市盤點適宜興建社宅之用地，目前已盤點出208處基地足供興建7萬戶社會住宅，將由內政部結合住都中心之量能分年分期推動。(四)另為因應營造業缺工及營建成本上漲等情事，內政部及住都中心將協助承攬社宅工程廠商申請聘雇移工，住都中心並已積極協助廠商出具營造計畫證明，俾利廠商向勞動部申辦召募許可。又住都中心持續推廣營建自動化（如預鑄工法）及配合市場行情酌調工程預算及協調機制，期減輕現階段缺工、原物料價格上漲之預期心理。此外，為利地方政府妥善興建管理社會住宅，內政部已研訂「社會住宅規劃設計、興建與營運管理作業參考手冊」提送各地方政府參考。四、關於都更緩不濟急問題：為促進各地方政府儘速辦理都市危險或老舊瀕危建築重建，內政部推動相關機制如下：(一)已完成修訂「都市危險及老舊建築物加速重建條例」、「都市更新條例」及擬具「都市更新及爭議處理審議會審議指引」，以加速都市危險或老舊瀕危建築重建。(二)補助各地方政府成立危險老舊建築物加速重建及自主都市更新輔導團，協助各地方政府輔導有意願辦理自主都市更新或危老建築重建者。(三)補助地方政府及中央機關（構）辦理都市更新整體計畫、成立政府主導都市更新專案辦公室、政府主導都市更新案先期規劃及公開評選作業等。(四)成立內政部推動小組及召開工作會議，積極輔導及督導各政府單位辦理都市更新案件，藉此拉升都市更新辦理效率、提升都市更新量能。(五)結合住都中心人力及資源，全面強化政府主導都市更新速度及質量。五、關於置動物保護警察問題：(一)農委會依據109年2月24日「設立動保警察議題研商會議」決議，委託國立臺南大學辦理「動保警察機制設計及可行性評估」專案計畫，該會並於109年12月25日將專案計畫結果於「動物保護諮議小組第四屆第二次諮詢委員會議」中提出，當次會議決議如下：1.農委會依專案評估結果，優先以改革方案1至3依序推動辦理，後續再視方案推動成果與政府資源持續提升政府有效處理虐殺動物等動保刑事案件效能。上開改革方案1至3之內容摘要如下：(1)改革方案1（盤點業務內容、學習有標竿）：A.盤點現行業務並進行分工設計。B.強化動檢員對於虐殺動物之刑事案件調查訓練及員警執行動保工作有關專業訓練。(2)改革方案2（補足基本需求、分工得以運作）：A.補足各地方政府動保主管機關之人力需求。B.給予動保/警政機關雙方人員對動保案件調查之有效誘因。C.建構動保/警政機關雙軌良好溝通網路。(3)改革方案3（給予動檢員足夠執法配套措施）：強化動檢員之法律職權。2.諮議委員對推動動保警察制度有共識，續透過社會倡議力量予以推動。3.內政部警政署建議依現行「警察處理動物保護法案件作業程序」並加強相關教育訓練，由警政與農政單位相互配合，持續提升虐殺動物等動保刑事案件處理效能。(二)另農委會就前開改革方案推動情形如下：1.建置全國違法動保案件登錄系統：行為人所受之行政處分由全國行政機關共享，不再存有每次皆為初犯之情形。2.108年度研擬「動物虐待案件之保全證據手冊」：訂定辦理虐待動物案件時，保全證據之應履行程序及裁罰相關規定，俾利動檢員進行行政調查、搜集及保全證據時有所依循。3.109年度研擬「違反動物保護法行政罰鍰裁量基準」：已邀集各地方政府動保主管機關研商，刻依與會人員建議調整裁量基準，俟確認後將函送各地方政府參考運用，以協助該等機關辦理違法案件之裁處時得減少裁量爭議。4.本年度研擬「動物保護案件調查流程手冊」：預計於年底完成後提供各地方政府動保主管機關執行動保案件調查之行政流程、判斷及裁量之參考。(三)又，內政部警政署建議維持現行動保機制，理由如下：1.置專責動保警察，其機動性與即時性無法與分駐（派出）所相比：警察機關現行受理「動物保護法」案件報案機制，係由各分駐（派出）所依該署函頒之「警察處理動物保護法案件作業程序」辦理，第一時間除派員處理外，須同時通知農政單位派員到場共同處理及認定。如置專責動保警察，受限於時空環境等因素，其機動性無法與分駐（派出）所警力相比。2.警察人員無法就目的事業主管法令為專業認定，且處罰權本屬各主管機關職權：警察非動保主管機關，且動物受虐案件認定涉及專業知能，仍需由主管機關動保單位人員針對動物受虐案件作專業之蒐證及檢驗，並依相關行政法規行使職權。3.「行政程序法」已有行政協助規範：主管機關執行前開稽查、取締等事項，如遇有危害非警察協助不足以排除或因該危害而有妨害公安秩序時，即得依該法第19條規定請求警察到場協助；案件若經主管機關認定構成「動物保護法」刑事不法要件，警察即應依「刑事訴訟法」相關規定調查，並依法移送或報告管轄檢察署偵辦。4.預算員額已達行政院匡定上限，如置動保警察恐弱化警察維護治安及交通安全之量能：行政院匡定全國警察機關警力上限為7萬3727人，各警察機關預算員額均須在匡列上限範圍內挪動調整，如另置專責動保警察，恐弱化警察維護治安及交通安全之量能。經統計106年至本年7月各地方政府警察局受理「動物保護法」報案總件數計743件；100年至本年8月各警察機關移送521件「動物保護法」刑事案件，平均每個警察局每月實際協助處理動保案件0.79件、移送動保刑事案件0.19件，另置專責動保警察單位似不符成本效益。5.已訂頒「警察處理動物保護法案件作業程序」，並已將動保相關課程納入常年訓練，將持續提升員警處理動保案件專業知能，並建構農政及警政良好溝通管道。","docUrl":"https://lci.ly.gov.tw/LyLCEW/communique1/work/111/34/LCIDC01_1113401_00006.doc","baseId":"cf6f2561-973b-f2c0-6ef8-773d38389dd6","isChunked":false,"chunkIndex":null,"totalChunks":null,"chunkText":"（五）行政院函送高委員嘉瑜就第10屆第4會期施政質詢之書面答復，請查照案。\n\n高委員就實價登錄2.0實施成效等問題所提質詢，經交據有關機關查復如下：一、關於實價登錄2.0實施成效問題：(一)有關租屋實價登錄部分，因租賃契約之訂定係屬債權行為，於租約雙方當事人合意即發生效力，與不動產買賣非經登記不生效力不同，故個人房東自行租賃案件難以掌握，稽查未申報案件之實務執行作業困難且稽查成本高，如無相關配套即貿然推動全面租賃實價登錄，恐將徒具形式而無實效，且應審慎考量強制登錄可能衍生之成本轉嫁等問題。內政部除推動具租稅優惠之租賃住宅包租代管制度及社會住宅政策等配套措施，期漸進式引導房東依法申報租賃所得，並將以有租賃制度為基礎，研議擴大租賃住宅資料勾稽比對之可行性。(二)另為維護租稅公平及促使房東誠實申報納稅，財政部各地區國稅局現有租賃所得查核機制如下：1.非自住房屋租賃查核作業：歷年來均將租賃所得列入重點查核項目，並將個人持有多屋者納入重點查核對象，依108年度綜合所得稅申報核定資料分析，申報核定房屋租賃所得約63萬戶（約112萬筆所得），核定租賃所得總額約1194億元。2.個人不動產相關所得專案查核作業計畫：配合行政院「健全房地產市場方案」，將租賃所得列為重點查核項目，就持有多屋者之租賃大樓、公寓或套（雅）房加強查核。3.個人間房屋租賃所得專案查核作業計畫：財政部於本（110）年8月12日核定「個人間房屋租賃所得專案查核作業計畫」，加強查核持有多戶（10戶以上）非自住住家用房屋者之租賃所得。(三)又，預售屋成交資訊申報期限改為簽約日起30日內，係本年7月1日實價登錄2.0始推動之新措施。考量現行除新制預售屋買賣案件外，尚有舊制由不動產代銷業成交之預售屋買賣案件須於緩衝期申報。為求資訊完整正確，以上開申報期限（簽約日起30日）加上受理機關行政作業所需時間規範提供查詢期程。倘新制推動較為成熟，將續予研議縮短申報期限、作業時間及申報內容等，俾使預售屋成交資訊更為即時、透明。(四)此外，實價登錄資訊係於每月1日、11日及21日對外提供查詢。依「不動產成交案件實際資訊申報登錄及預售屋銷售資訊備查辦法」第18條、第19條及第20條規定略以，直轄市、縣（市）主管機關對於不動產買賣、租賃及預售屋案件實際資訊，須篩選去除顯異於市場正常交易價格及特殊交易之資訊並整理後，方對外提供查詢，以確保資訊正確性。目前每月3次之揭露頻率，係內政部邀集各地方政府研商後，考量人力及業務負擔所做之統一標準，以利相關資料揭露期程一致，避免查詢者混淆。二、關於推動實坪制以落實居住正義問題：(一)依「民法」規定，區分所有建物包括專有部分及共有部分（即公共設施），依法均應辦理物權登記。公設係民眾日常實際使用空間，與居住品質相關，我國將公設詳細登記，符合國人確認產權範圍之交易習慣，並可減少公設認定問題及交易糾紛。又房屋買賣價格係由市場決定，共有部分（公設）登記之多寡，僅係改變單價計算標準，房屋出售總價並不因此改變。(二)內政部民國107年至108年更新實價登錄網站，已提供民眾可自由查詢「房屋建坪單價計算」，復以「預售屋及成屋買賣定型化契約應記載及不得記載事項」亦明確規範建商於交易時應將主建物、公設等資訊分別明列，以提供完整透明之交易資訊。三、關於社宅興建速度不如預期問題：(一)內政部刻依據行政院106年核定之社會住宅興辦計畫積極推動8年20萬戶社會住宅政策，規劃以直接興建12萬戶及包租代管8萬戶民間住宅方式辦理，中期目標為109年達成直接興建4萬戶及包租代管4萬戶，合計8萬戶；長期目標預計至113年達成20萬戶社會住宅之供給量。(二)第一階段（106-109年）社會住宅直接興建4萬戶之目標已於109年底如期達成。截至本年10月底止，各地方政府及國家住宅及都市更新中心（以下簡稱住都中心）提報社會住宅興辦案件，計有6436戶、新完工1萬2341戶、興建中2萬1115戶及已決標待開工9927戶，合計4萬9819戶。(三)為規劃下一階段（110年-113年）直接興建8萬戶之目標，除地方政府將賡續推動約1.2萬戶外，內政部自107年起即於全國各縣市盤點適宜興建社宅之用地，目前已盤點出208處基地足供興建7萬戶社會住宅，將由內政部結合住都中心之量能分年分期推動。(四)另為因應營造業缺工及營建成本上漲等情事，內政部及住都中心將協助承攬社宅工程廠商申請聘雇移工，住都中心並已積極協助廠商出具營造計畫證明，俾利廠商向勞動部申辦召募許可。又住都中心持續推廣營建自動化（如預鑄工法）及配合市場行情酌調工程預算及協調機制，期減輕現階段缺工、原物料價格上漲之預期心理。此外，為利地方政府妥善興建管理社會住宅，內政部已研訂「社會住宅規劃設計、興建與營運管理作業參考手冊」提送各地方政府參考。四、關於都更緩不濟急問題：為促進各地方政府儘速辦理都市危險或老舊瀕危建築重建，內政部推動相關機制如下：(一)已完成修訂「都市危險及老舊建築物加速重建條例」、「都市更新條例」及擬具「都市更新及爭議處理審議會審議指引」，以加速都市危險或老舊瀕危建築重建。(二)補助各地方政府成立危險老舊建築物加速重建及自主都市更新輔導團，協助各地方政府輔導有意願辦理自主都市更新或危老建築重建者。(三)補助地方政府及中央機關（構）辦理都市更新整體計畫、成立政府主導都市更新專案辦公室、政府主導都市更新案先期規劃及公開評選作業等。(四)成立內政部推動小組及召開工作會議，積極輔導及督導各政府單位辦理都市更新案件，藉此拉升都市更新辦理效率、提升都市更新量能。(五)結合住都中心人力及資源，全面強化政府主導都市更新速度及質量。五、關於置動物保護警察問題：(一)農委會依據109年2月24日「設立動保警察議題研商會議」決議，委託國立臺南大學辦理「動保警察機制設計及可行性評估」專案計畫，該會並於109年12月25日將專案計畫結果於「動物保護諮議小組第四屆第二次諮詢委員會議」中提出，當次會議決議如下：1.農委會依專案評估結果，優先以改革方案1至3依序推動辦理，後續再視方案推動成果與政府資源持續提升政府有效處理虐殺動物等動保刑事案件效能。上開改革方案1至3之內容摘要如下：(1)改革方案1（盤點業務內容、學習有標竿）：A.盤點現行業務並進行分工設計。B.強化動檢員對於虐殺動物之刑事案件調查訓練及員警執行動保工作有關專業訓練。(2)改革方案2（補足基本需求、分工得以運作）：A.補足各地方政府動保主管機關之人力需求。B.給予動保/警政機關雙方人員對動保案件調查之有效誘因。C.建構動保/警政機關雙軌良好溝通網路。(3)改革方案3（給予動檢員足夠執法配套措施）：強化動檢員之法律職權。2.諮議委員對推動動保警察制度有共識，續透過社會倡議力量予以推動。3.內政部警政署建議依現行「警察處理動物保護法案件作業程序」並加強相關教育訓練，由警政與農政單位相互配合，持續提升虐殺動物等動保刑事案件處理效能。(二)另農委會就前開改革方案推動情形如下：1.建置全國違法動保案件登錄系統：行為人所受之行政處分由全國行政機關共享，不再存有每次皆為初犯之情形。2.108年度研擬「動物虐待案件之保全證據手冊」：訂定辦理虐待動物案件時，保全證據之應履行程序及裁罰相關規定，俾利動檢員進行行政調查、搜集及保全證據時有所依循。3.109年度研擬「違反動物保護法行政罰鍰裁量基準」：已邀集各地方政府動保主管機關研商，刻依與會人員建議調整裁量基準，俟確認後將函送各地方政府參考運用，以協助該等機關辦理違法案件之裁處時得減少裁量爭議。4.本年度研擬「動物保護案件調查流程手冊」：預計於年底完成後提供各地方政府動保主管機關執行動保案件調查之行政流程、判斷及裁量之參考。(三)又，內政部警政署建議維持現行動保機制，理由如下：1.置專責動保警察，其機動性與即時性無法與分駐（派出）所相比：警察機關現行受理「動物保護法」案件報案機制，係由各分駐（派出）所依該署函頒之「警察處理動物保護法案件作業程序」辦理，第一時間除派員處理外，須同時通知農政單位派員到場共同處理及認定。如置專責動保警察，受限於時空環境等因素，其機動性無法與分駐（派出）所警力相比。2.警察人員無法就目的事業主管法令為專業認定，且處罰權本屬各主管機關職權：警察非動保主管機關，且動物受虐案件認定涉及專業知能，仍需由主管機關動保單位人員針對動物受虐案件作專業之蒐證及檢驗，並依相關行政法規行使職權。3.「行政程序法」已有行政協助規範：主管機關執行前開稽查、取締等事項，如遇有危害非警察協助不足以排除或因該危害而有妨害公安秩序時，即得依該法第19條規定請求警察到場協助；案件若經主管機關認定構成「動物保護法」刑事不法要件，警察即應依「刑事訴訟法」相關規定調查，並依法移送或報告管轄檢察署偵辦。4.預算員額已達行政院匡定上限，如置動保警察恐弱化警察維護治安及交通安全之量能：行政院匡定全國警察機關警力上限為7萬3727人，各警察機關預算員額均須在匡列上限範圍內挪動調整，如另置專責動保警察，恐弱化警察維護治安及交通安全之量能。經統計106年至本年7月各地方政府警察局受理「動物保護法」報案總件數計743件；100年至本年8月各警察機關移送521件「動物保護法」刑事案件，平均每個警察局每月實際協助處理動保案件0.79件、移送動保刑事案件0.19件，另置專責動保警察單位似不符成本效益。5.已訂頒「警察處理動物保護法案件作業程序」，並已將動保相關課程納入常年訓練，將持續提升員警處理動保案件專業知能，並建構農政及警政良好溝通管道。"}}

業需求，行政院農委會林務局將在地質穩定、無礙國土保安及林業經營之前提下，積極協處用地提供使用事宜。(四)有關研議開放烏來台車委外營運部分：1.烏來台車自107年8月26日復駛後，遊客人數及營運收入均穩定成長，108年搭乘人次更突破60萬，惟近2年之營運狀況略受疫情影響。2.行政院農委會林務局新竹林管處業於109年委託辦理烏來台車委外營運之可行性評估，惟該案促參推動因面臨潛在內、外在困境，尚未具備民間促參相關條件，爰暫不推動。另烏來台車現有10組車組，本（110）年辦理2組車體汰換、邊坡防落石治理及推動林業文化行銷活動，現並已規劃配合烏來區公所年度活動延長營運時間至夜間8時，期確保營運安全及提供國人更優質之搭乘體驗。二、關於推動綠色經濟，協助產業永續經營問題：(一)為加速減碳並強化氣候變遷調適，行政院環保署於本年10月21日提出「溫室氣體減量及管理法」修正草案，並將法案名稱修改為「氣候變遷因應法」，修法重點包括：1.2050淨零排放目標入法：現行國家長期減量之目標為2050年溫室氣體排放量降為2005年之50%以下，此次修正為2050年溫室氣體淨零排放。2.提升層級強化氣候治理：溫室氣體減量及氣候變遷調適事項涉及跨部門權責，本次修法明定中央由行政院國家永續發展委員會協調、分工或整合國家因應氣候變遷基本方針、跨部會相關業務之決策。3.增訂氣候變遷調適專章：明定調適工作自提升國家整體因應氣候變遷基礎能力、強化氣候變遷科學、情境、風險等資訊建立，以及評估、確定推動架構等面向推動。4.強化排放管制及誘因機制促進減量：納入對製造、運輸及建築等各部門排放行為之管制機制，以及規定新設污染源應採最佳可行技術並進行增量抵換，減少排放增量對環境衝擊；另亦強化對事業或各級政府提出自願減量計畫，據以執行溫室氣體減量措施者，核予減量額度之誘因機制。5.徵收碳費專款專用：本次增訂對國內排放源徵收碳費，並將收入專款專用於辦理溫室氣體減量工作、發展低碳與負排放之技術及產業、補助及獎勵投資溫室氣體減量技術等；惟碳費制定須考量多重因素，仍須與相關利害關係人探討凝聚共識。6.因應國際碳邊境調整機制：增訂未來中央主管機關得對特定產品訂定碳含量計算及認定方式，並參考國際經貿情勢對高碳含量之進口產品徵收碳費，以維持我國產業競爭力。(二)推動碳定價初期以碳費先行：1.碳定價已成為國際重要減碳誘因工具，透過碳排外部成本內部化，促使產業採行減碳措施。目前國際間碳定價主要方式為徵收碳稅/費或實施總量管制及排放交易機制（Emission

Schemes，ETS）等二類。考量我國碳市場規模小、排放源集中及流動性不足等問題，行政院環保署規劃以碳費先行之模式實施我國碳定價制度。2.行政院環保署擬透過新增徵收碳費規定，分階段擴大徵收對象，初期以大排放源（年排放2.5萬噸以上）為主，未來再逐漸擴大至中小型製造業及一定規模以上商業。有關碳費徵收對象、費率及獎勵補助等相關事項，將於子法中訂定。(三)協助產業因應全球2050淨零趨勢：1.製造業部分：經濟部工業局已結合全國工業總會及鋼鐵、石化等七大產業公協會，成立淨零排碳工作小組，提出製造部門淨零轉型策略及作法，並以製程改善、能源使用及循環經濟為三大策略方向，盤點各產業技術面、財務面、政策法規面等配套需求。短期將結合地方政府持續推動產業低碳轉型，中長期將朝提升能源效率、推動使用綠電及擴大低碳補助三大方向加大減量推力，並透過政府投入資源、提供經濟誘因及完善配套措施等方式協助產業減碳。2.中小企業部分：政府透過輔導方式協助中小企業進行循環經濟創新技術、製程、營運服務模式或產品開發等創新應用，並進行溫室氣體減量及管理、碳足跡、水足跡盤查或監控系統建置，強化企業綠色永續能力。另針對受國際碳稅課徵衝擊較大之出口導向製造業者，將其列為優先輔導對象，提供診斷諮詢並輔導業者取得國際碳足跡驗證，以及協助企業取得國際供應商訂單等。(四)至有關碳邊境稅部分，財政部將持續關注歐盟實施碳邊境調整機制（CBAM）進展，並視開徵碳費之實際情形，配合行政院整體政策規劃，就環境面、經濟面及產業面綜整評估是否有推動碳稅（能源稅）之必要性，以免影響產業發展、經濟民生之穩定及能源價格之可負擔性。三、關於大臺北防洪水工模型試驗場域問題：(一)有關將經濟部水利署新店辦公區大臺北防洪試驗場域設計為多功能場域部分，經濟部水利署新店辦公區扣除已配合安坑捷運線經過及設置k8站所使用之面積548坪，以及水工大樓基地面積825坪，可運用面積僅剩約3500坪。該署業將該場域規劃作為水環境暨防災教育園區，除繼續作為臺北防洪淡水河全流域水工模型試驗場域外，更導入防災科技研究展示及環境教育互動，並已與新和國小協調繼續保留原有運動場地。經濟部水利署就現址在維持辦公、水利試驗及環教展示並兼顧新和國小學童之運動需求下，尚無多餘空間可規劃作為多功能大樓或停車場。(二)有關將大臺北防洪試驗場域設施與國立臺灣大學農工學院附設水工試驗所或成功大學水工試驗所整合，將現址提供新和國小設立體育館，並釋放空間供地方政府及內政部辦理社會住宅部分：1.本場域為提升水工試驗準確性，水工模型試驗水平比例尺改採用1/200，包括漸變段模型所需場地範圍面積自現有約2948坪增加至約3500坪，另需具有室內遮雨場棚、試驗場周邊風向不可過大、儘量設置於淡水河流域周邊、場地地質應為非地下水管制區及避開會淹水地勢等條件。2.經查國立臺灣大學農工學院附設水工試驗所為室內試驗場區域，佔地面積約1154坪，主要設備及場地係作為相關系所教學理論之驗證及學術基礎研究使用，與本場域功能需求不同，復以該校對於接受委託特定課題進行工程設計或規劃案之水工模型試驗、水理及水文數值模擬分析等應用性及服務性之研究，常需向經濟部水利署申請使用本場域相關設施；另國立成功大學水工試驗所除未位於淡水河流域周邊，其室內試驗面積亦無法滿足本場域需求。3.另依據行政院秘書長101年4月26日函文及歷年協商原則，如需取得本場域土地，新北市政府需提供對等土地交換供水工試驗場遷移後方能取得，經該府及財政部國產署篩選結果，目前尚無符合條件之標的。四、關於四大公投問題：(一)萊豬議題部分：1.為拓展我國際經貿空間，政府在確保國民食安及健康之前提下，依據科學證據及參考國際標準，審慎訂定進口豬肉含萊克多巴胺容許量標準，進口豬肉符合上開規定，消費者食用即安全無虞。2.另國人消費習慣係以生鮮溫體豬肉為主，無法以進口冷凍豬肉替代，進口豬肉占比維持約在10%。開放萊豬進口後，豬肉及其製品依法須落實清楚標示原產地，可供消費者明確辨識及選購。復以國內養豬業禁用萊克多巴胺，亦可有效區隔進口豬肉，由市場機制決定國產豬肉市占率。3.為保障養豬農民權益，行政院農委會自本年起穩健執行養豬產業全面轉型升級中程計畫，推動「保障豬農收益穩定產銷」、「豬隻死亡強制保險增加保費補助」、「策略性擴大出口拓銷臺灣豬」、「推動屠宰場現代化及肉品冷鏈升級」、「輔導養豬場現代化轉型升級」、「提升進口肉品萊劑查檢量能與產地標示查核」、「獎勵業者標示並使用國產畜產品」及「多元整合行銷養豬產業」等八大工作，積極輔導養豬產業提升整體體質及永續競爭力，期發揮提高育成率、降低生產成本、強化外銷佈局及完善產業鏈加值等實質效益，在面對貿易高度自由化之挑戰下，捍衛國產豬肉9成之自給率。(二)另有關所提經濟部應投入氫能技術發展部分，現行我國氫能發展推動策略規劃如下：1.發展氫能應用：(1)短中期以能源部門及工業用氫（產業）低碳化應用為主，並採國際合作或直接引進相關應用技術。(2)台電公司：短期以混氫燃氣發電性能研析，中長期以全氫能電廠設置方向推動。(3)中鋼公司：短期以「鋼化聯產」煉鋼製程副產氫轉為合成燃料，中長期以焦炭混氫降低煉鋼製程碳排放，導入純「氫能煉鋼」。2.開發氫氣來源：短中期以海外進口藍氫、綠氫為主，長期於我國再生能源供應量充足之前提下，逐步擴大自產綠氫。3.建設基礎設施：短期運用天然氣有設施，評估氫氣進口儲存設施建置地點，中長期則配合應用場域建構氫氣基礎設施。4.為具體推動上開發展策略，經濟部業成立氫能推動小組，以減碳為目標發展氫能技術及應用，原則每季召開1次工作小組會議。(三)又，本年舉行之全國性公投，為首次全國性公投單獨舉行投票，中選會已加強宣導投票日期、時間、投票時應注意事項及國民年滿18歲有公民投票權。另為使民眾充分瞭解本次全國性公投案內容及正、反方意見論述，該會除依法彙集公投案主文、理由書、政府機關意見書及其他投票有關規定等編印公投公報，並定於本年11月13日至12月11日於華視、民視、中視、臺視及公視舉辦全國性公投案意見發表會，每一公投案各舉辦5場，以供公投案正、反意見支持代表發表意見。","docUrl":"https://lci.ly.gov.tw/LyLCEW/communique1/work/111/34/LCIDC01_1113401_00006.doc","baseId":"aab3661f-0f4a-29bf-24d1-8c21517adbdc","isChunked":true,"chunkIndex":0,"totalChunks":2,"chunkText":"（九）行政院函送羅委員明才就第10屆第4會期施政質詢之書面答復，請查照案。\n\n羅委員就振興烏來觀光產業等問題所提質詢，經交據有關機關查復如下：一、關於振興烏來觀光產業問題：(一)有關建議成立烏來電廠文化園區部分，台電公司桂山發電廠業於民國109年7月4日啟用「新店溪流域水力發電文物展示館」，除展示早期新店溪流域老照片，另展示近30件1950至1960年代電廠所使用之物件及手寫文件，以及13座自全國各地電廠運抵之水輪機，為台電公司繼大觀、大甲溪等電廠後設立之第5座水力發電展示館。另該展館周邊亦進行生態環境營造，並與烏來區觀光旅遊結合，台電公司並將配合地方政府活動，共同振興烏來觀光產業。(二)有關協調臺北市政府開放翡翠水庫部分，經查翡翠水庫現已設有翡翠水庫環境學習中心，該中心依據「水旅程概念」，以翡翠水庫為基地，在有基礎上持續深化推動環境教育，除結合上游集水區保育及下游自來水處理，並結合相關環境教育場所之外部資源擴大服務範圍及品質，建立全方位之水資源環境教育。(三)有關加速修復烏來區加九寮步道部分，烏來區加九寮步道為新北市烏來區公所設置及維護管理之步道，因颱風造成步道沿線地質不穩，為確保遊客安全，目前由烏來區公所暫時封閉。該公所倘有步道修復作業需求，行政院農委會林務局將在地質穩定、無礙國土保安及林業經營之前提下，積極協處用地提供使用事宜。(四)有關研議開放烏來台車委外營運部分：1.烏來台車自107年8月26日復駛後，遊客人數及營運收入均穩定成長，108年搭乘人次更突破60萬，惟近2年之營運狀況略受疫情影響。2.行政院農委會林務局新竹林管處業於109年委託辦理烏來台車委外營運之可行性評估，惟該案促參推動因面臨潛在內、外在困境，尚未具備民間促參相關條件，爰暫不推動。另烏來台車現有10組車組，本（110）年辦理2組車體汰換、邊坡防落石治理及推動林業文化行銷活動，現並已規劃配合烏來區公所年度活動延長營運時間至夜間8時，期確保營運安全及提供國人更優質之搭乘體驗。二、關於推動綠色經濟，協助產業永續經營問題：(一)為加速減碳並強化氣候變遷調適，行政院環保署於本年10月21日提出「溫室氣體減量及管理法」修正草案，並將法案名稱修改為「氣候變遷因應法」，修法重點包括：1.2050淨零排放目標入法：現行國家長期減量之目標為2050年溫室氣體排放量降為2005年之50%以下，此次修正為2050年溫室氣體淨零排放。2.提升層級強化氣候治理：溫室氣體減量及氣候變遷調適事項涉及跨部門權責，本次修法明定中央由行政院國家永續發展委員會協調、分工或整合國家因應氣候變遷基本方針、跨部會相關業務之決策。3.增訂氣候變遷調適專章：明定調適工作自提升國家整體因應氣候變遷基礎能力、強化氣候變遷科學、情境、風險等資訊建立，以及評估、確定推動架構等面向推動。4.強化排放管制及誘因機制促進減量：納入對製造、運輸及建築等各部門排放行為之管制機制，以及規定新設污染源應採最佳可行技術並進行增量抵換，減少排放增量對環境衝擊；另亦強化對事業或各級政府提出自願減量計畫，據以執行溫室氣體減量措施者，核予減量額度之誘因機制。5.徵收碳費專款專用：本次增訂對國內排放源徵收碳費，並將收入專款專用於辦理溫室氣體減量工作、發展低碳與負排放之技術及產業、補助及獎勵投資溫室氣體減量技術等；惟碳費制定須考量多重因素，仍須與相關利害關係人探討凝聚共識。6.因應國際碳邊境調整機制：增訂未來中央主管機關得對特定產品訂定碳含量計算及認定方式，並參考國際經貿情勢對高碳含量之進口產品徵收碳費，以維持我國產業競爭力。(二)推動碳定價初期以碳費先行：1.碳定價已成為國際重要減碳誘因工具，透過碳排外部成本內部化，促使產業採行減碳措施。目前國際間碳定價主要方式為徵收碳稅/費或實施總量管制及排放交易機制（Emission Trading Schemes，ETS）等二類。考量我國碳市場規模小、排放源集中及流動性不足等問題，行政院環保署規劃以碳費先行之模式實施我國碳定價制度。2.行政院環保署擬透過新增徵收碳費規定，分階段擴大徵收對象，初期以大排放源（年排放2.5萬噸以上）為主，未來再逐漸擴大至中小型製造業及一定規模以上商業。有關碳費徵收對象、費率及獎勵補助等相關事項，將於子法中訂定。(三)協助產業因應全球2050淨零趨勢：1.製造業部分：經濟部工業局已結合全國工業總會及鋼鐵、石化等七大產業公協會，成立淨零排碳工作小組，提出製造部門淨零轉型策略及作法，並以製程改善、能源使用及循環經濟為三大策略方向，盤點各產業技術面、財務面、政策法規面等配套需求。短期將結合地方政府持續推動產業低碳轉型，中長期將朝提升能源效率、推動使用綠電及擴大低碳補助三大方向加大減量推力，並透過政府投入資源、提供經濟誘因及完善配套措施等方式協助產業減碳。2.中小企業部分：政府透過輔導方式協助中小企業進行循環經濟創新技術、製程、營運服務模式或產品開發等創新應用，並進行溫室氣體減量及管理、碳足跡、水足跡盤查或監控系統建置，強化企業綠色永續能力。另針對受國際碳稅課徵衝擊較大之出口導向製造業者，將其列為優先輔導對象，提供診斷諮詢並輔導業者取得國際碳足跡驗證，以及協助企業取得國際供應商訂單等。(四)至有關碳邊境稅部分，財政部將持續關注歐盟實施碳邊境調整機制（CBAM）進展，並視開徵碳費之實際情形，配合行政院整體政策規劃，就環境面、經濟面及產業面綜整評估是否有推動碳稅（能源稅）之必要性，以免影響產業發展、經濟民生之穩定及能源價格之可負擔性。三、關於大臺北防洪水工模型試驗場域問題：(一)有關將經濟部水利署新店辦公區大臺北防洪試驗場域設計為多功能場域部分，經濟部水利署新店辦公區扣除已配合安坑捷運線經過及設置k8站所使用之面積548坪，以及水工大樓基地面積825坪，可運用面積僅剩約3500坪。該署業將該場域規劃作為水環境暨防災教育園區，除繼續作為臺北防洪淡水河全流域水工模型試驗場域外，更導入防災科技研究展示及環境教育互動，並已與新和國小協調繼續保留原有運動場地。經濟部水利署就現址在維持辦公、水利試驗及環教展示並兼顧新和國小學童之運動需求下，尚無多餘空間可規劃作為多功能大樓或停車場。(二)有關將大臺北防洪試驗場域設施與國立臺灣大學農工學院附設水工試驗所或成功大學水工試驗所整合，將現址提供新和國小設立體育館，並釋放空間供地方政府及內政部辦理社會住宅部分：1.本場域為提升水工試驗準確性，水工模型試驗水平比例尺改採用1/200，包括漸變段模型所需場地範圍面積自現有約2948坪增加至約3500坪，另需具有室內遮雨場棚、試驗場周邊風向不可過大、儘量設置於淡水河流域周邊、場地地質應為非地下水管制區及避開會淹水地勢等條件。2.經查國立臺灣大學農工學院附設水工試驗所為室內試驗場區域，佔地面積約1154坪，主要設備及場地係作為相關系所教學理論之驗證及學術基礎研究使用，與本場域功能需求不同，復以該校對於接受委託特定課題進行工程設計或規劃案之水工模型試驗、水理及水文數值模擬分析等應用性及服務性之研究，常需向經濟部水利署申請使用本場域相關設施；另國立成功大學水工試驗所除未位於淡水河流域周邊，其室內試驗面積亦無法滿足本場域需求。3.另依據行政院秘書長101年4月26日函文及歷年協商原則，如需取得本場域土地，新北市政府需提供對等土地交換供水工試驗場遷移後方能取得，經該府及財政部國產署篩選結果，目前尚無符合條件之標的。四、關於四大公投問題：(一)萊豬議題部分：1.為拓展我國際經貿空間，政府在確保國民食安及健康之前提下，依據科學證據及參考國際標準，審慎訂定進口豬肉含萊克多巴胺容許量標準，進口豬肉符合上開規定，消費者食用即安全無虞。2.另國人消費習慣係以生鮮溫體豬肉為主，無法以進口冷凍豬肉替代，進口豬肉占比維持約在10%。開放萊豬進口後，豬肉及其製品依法須落實清楚標示原產地，可供消費者明確辨識及選購。復以國內養豬業禁用萊克多巴胺，亦可有效區隔進口豬肉，由市場機制決定國產豬肉市占率。3.為保障養豬農民權益，行政院農委會自本年起穩健執行養豬產業全面轉型升級中程計畫，推動「保障豬農收益穩定產銷」、「豬隻死亡強制保險增加保費補助」、「策略性擴大出口拓銷臺灣豬」、「推動屠宰場現代化及肉品冷鏈升級」、「輔導養豬場現代化轉型升級」、「提升進口肉品萊劑查檢量能與產地標示查核」、「獎勵業者標示並使用國產畜產品」及「多元整合行銷養豬產業」等八大工作，積極輔導養豬產業提升整體體質及永續競爭力，期發揮提高育成率、降低生產成本、強化外銷佈局及完善產業鏈加值等實質效益，在面對貿易高度自由化之挑戰下，捍衛國產豬肉9成之自給率。(二)另有關所提經濟部應投入氫能技術發展部分，現行我國氫能發展推動策略規劃如下：1.發展氫能應用：(1)短中期以能源部門及工業用氫（產業）低碳化應用為主，並採國際合作或直接引進相關應用技術。(2)台電公司：短期以混氫燃氣發電性能研析，中長期以全氫能電廠設置方向推動。(3)中鋼公司：短期以「鋼化聯產」煉鋼製程副產氫轉為合成燃料，中長期以焦炭混氫降低煉鋼製程碳排放，導入純「氫能煉鋼」。2.開發氫氣來源：短中期以海外進口藍氫、綠氫為主，長期於我國再生能源供應量充足之前提下，逐步擴大自產綠氫。3.建設基礎設施：短期運用天然氣有設施，評估氫氣進口儲存設施建置地點，中長期則配合應用場域建構氫氣基礎設施。4.為具體推動上開發展策略，經濟部業成立氫能推動小組，以減碳為目標發展氫能技術及應用，原則每季召開1次工作小組會議。(三)又，本年舉行之全國性公投，為首次全國性公投單獨舉行投票，中選會已加強宣導投票日期、時間、投票時應注意事項及國民年滿18歲有公民"}}

關加速修復烏來區加九寮步道部分，烏來區加九寮步道為新北市烏來區公所設置及維護管理之步道，因颱風造成步道沿線地質不穩，為確保遊客安全，目前由烏來區公所暫時封閉。該公所倘有步道修復作業需求，行政院農委會林務局將在地質穩定、無礙國土保安及林業經營之前提下，積極協處用地提供使用事宜。(四)有關研議開放烏來台車委外營運部分：1.烏來台車自107年8月26日復駛後，遊客人數及營運收入均穩定成長，108年搭乘人次更突破60萬，惟近2年之營運狀況略受疫情影響。2.行政院農委會林務局新竹林管處業於109年委託辦理烏來台車委外營運之可行性評估，惟該案促參推動因面臨潛在內、外在困境，尚未具備民間促參相關條件，爰暫不推動。另烏來台車現有10組車組，本（110）年辦理2組車體汰換、邊坡防落石治理及推動林業文化行銷活動，現並已規劃配合烏來區公所年度活動延長營運時間至夜間8時，期確保營運安全及提供國人更優質之搭乘體驗。二、關於推動綠色經濟，協助產業永續經營問題：(一)為加速減碳並強化氣候變遷調適，行政院環保署於本年10月21日提出「溫室氣體減量及管理法」修正草案，並將法案名稱修改為「氣候變遷因應法」，修法重點包括：1.2050淨零排放目標入法：現行國家長期減量之目標為2050年溫室氣體排放量降為2005年之50%以下，此次修正為2050年溫室氣體淨零排放。2.提升層級強化氣候治理：溫室氣體減量及氣候變遷調適事項涉及跨部門權責，本次修法明定中央由行政院國家永續發展委員會協調、分工或整合國家因應氣候變遷基本方針、跨部會相關業務之決策。3.增訂氣候變遷調適專章：明定調適工作自提升國家整體因應氣候變遷基礎能力、強化氣候變遷科學、情境、風險等資訊建立，以及評估、確定推動架構等面向推動。4.強化排放管制及誘因機制促進減量：納入對製造、運輸及建築等各部門排放行為之管制機制，以及規定新設污染源應採最佳可行技術並進行增量抵換，減少排放增量對環境衝擊；另亦強化對事業或各級政府提出自願減量計畫，據以執行溫室氣體減量措施者，核予減量額度之誘因機制。5.徵收碳費專款專用：本次增訂對國內排放源徵收碳費，並將收入專款專用於辦理溫室氣體減量工作、發展低碳與負排放之技術及產業、補助及獎勵投資溫室氣體減量技術等；惟碳費制定須考量多重因素，仍須與相關利害關係人探討凝聚共識。6.因應國際碳邊境調整機制：增訂未來中央主管機關得對特定產品訂定碳含量計算及認定方式，並參考國際經貿情勢對高碳含量之進口產品徵收碳費，以維持我國產業競爭力。(二)推動碳定價初期以碳費先行：1.碳定價已成為國際重要減碳誘因工具，透過碳排外部成本內部化，促使產業採行減碳措施。目前國際間碳定價主要方式為徵收碳稅/費或實施總量管制及排放交易機制（Emission

Schemes，ETS）等二類。考量我國碳市場規模小、排放源集中及流動性不足等問題，行政院環保署規劃以碳費先行之模式實施我國碳定價制度。2.行政院環保署擬透過新增徵收碳費規定，分階段擴大徵收對象，初期以大排放源（年排放2.5萬噸以上）為主，未來再逐漸擴大至中小型製造業及一定規模以上商業。有關碳費徵收對象、費率及獎勵補助等相關事項，將於子法中訂定。(三)協助產業因應全球2050淨零趨勢：1.製造業部分：經濟部工業局已結合全國工業總會及鋼鐵、石化等七大產業公協會，成立淨零排碳工作小組，提出製造部門淨零轉型策略及作法，並以製程改善、能源使用及循環經濟為三大策略方向，盤點各產業技術面、財務面、政策法規面等配套需求。短期將結合地方政府持續推動產業低碳轉型，中長期將朝提升能源效率、推動使用綠電及擴大低碳補助三大方向加大減量推力，並透過政府投入資源、提供經濟誘因及完善配套措施等方式協助產業減碳。2.中小企業部分：政府透過輔導方式協助中小企業進行循環經濟創新技術、製程、營運服務模式或產品開發等創新應用，並進行溫室氣體減量及管理、碳足跡、水足跡盤查或監控系統建置，強化企業綠色永續能力。另針對受國際碳稅課徵衝擊較大之出口導向製造業者，將其列為優先輔導對象，提供診斷諮詢並輔導業者取得國際碳足跡驗證，以及協助企業取得國際供應商訂單等。(四)至有關碳邊境稅部分，財政部將持續關注歐盟實施碳邊境調整機制（CBAM）進展，並視開徵碳費之實際情形，配合行政院整體政策規劃，就環境面、經濟面及產業面綜整評估是否有推動碳稅（能源稅）之必要性，以免影響產業發展、經濟民生之穩定及能源價格之可負擔性。三、關於大臺北防洪水工模型試驗場域問題：(一)有關將經濟部水利署新店辦公區大臺北防洪試驗場域設計為多功能場域部分，經濟部水利署新店辦公區扣除已配合安坑捷運線經過及設置k8站所使用之面積548坪，以及水工大樓基地面積825坪，可運用面積僅剩約3500坪。該署業將該場域規劃作為水環境暨防災教育園區，除繼續作為臺北防洪淡水河全流域水工模型試驗場域外，更導入防災科技研究展示及環境教育互動，並已與新和國小協調繼續保留原有運動場地。經濟部水利署就現址在維持辦公、水利試驗及環教展示並兼顧新和國小學童之運動需求下，尚無多餘空間可規劃作為多功能大樓或停車場。(二)有關將大臺北防洪試驗場域設施與國立臺灣大學農工學院附設水工試驗所或成功大學水工試驗所整合，將現址提供新和國小設立體育館，並釋放空間供地方政府及內政部辦理社會住宅部分：1.本場域為提升水工試驗準確性，水工模型試驗水平比例尺改採用1/200，包括漸變段模型所需場地範圍面積自現有約2948坪增加至約3500坪，另需具有室內遮雨場棚、試驗場周邊風向不可過大、儘量設置於淡水河流域周邊、場地地質應為非地下水管制區及避開會淹水地勢等條件。2.經查國立臺灣大學農工學院附設水工試驗所為室內試驗場區域，佔地面積約1154坪，主要設備及場地係作為相關系所教學理論之驗證及學術基礎研究使用，與本場域功能需求不同，復以該校對於接受委託特定課題進行工程設計或規劃案之水工模型試驗、水理及水文數值模擬分析等應用性及服務性之研究，常需向經濟部水利署申請使用本場域相關設施；另國立成功大學水工試驗所除未位於淡水河流域周邊，其室內試驗面積亦無法滿足本場域需求。3.另依據行政院秘書長101年4月26日函文及歷年協商原則，如需取得本場域土地，新北市政府需提供對等土地交換供水工試驗場遷移後方能取得，經該府及財政部國產署篩選結果，目前尚無符合條件之標的。四、關於四大公投問題：(一)萊豬議題部分：1.為拓展我國際經貿空間，政府在確保國民食安及健康之前提下，依據科學證據及參考國際標準，審慎訂定進口豬肉含萊克多巴胺容許量標準，進口豬肉符合上開規定，消費者食用即安全無虞。2.另國人消費習慣係以生鮮溫體豬肉為主，無法以進口冷凍豬肉替代，進口豬肉占比維持約在10%。開放萊豬進口後，豬肉及其製品依法須落實清楚標示原產地，可供消費者明確辨識及選購。復以國內養豬業禁用萊克多巴胺，亦可有效區隔進口豬肉，由市場機制決定國產豬肉市占率。3.為保障養豬農民權益，行政院農委會自本年起穩健執行養豬產業全面轉型升級中程計畫，推動「保障豬農收益穩定產銷」、「豬隻死亡強制保險增加保費補助」、「策略性擴大出口拓銷臺灣豬」、「推動屠宰場現代化及肉品冷鏈升級」、「輔導養豬場現代化轉型升級」、「提升進口肉品萊劑查檢量能與產地標示查核」、「獎勵業者標示並使用國產畜產品」及「多元整合行銷養豬產業」等八大工作，積極輔導養豬產業提升整體體質及永續競爭力，期發揮提高育成率、降低生產成本、強化外銷佈局及完善產業鏈加值等實質效益，在面對貿易高度自由化之挑戰下，捍衛國產豬肉9成之自給率。(二)另有關所提經濟部應投入氫能技術發展部分，現行我國氫能發展推動策略規劃如下：1.發展氫能應用：(1)短中期以能源部門及工業用氫（產業）低碳化應用為主，並採國際合作或直接引進相關應用技術。(2)台電公司：短期以混氫燃氣發電性能研析，中長期以全氫能電廠設置方向推動。(3)中鋼公司：短期以「鋼化聯產」煉鋼製程副產氫轉為合成燃料，中長期以焦炭混氫降低煉鋼製程碳排放，導入純「氫能煉鋼」。2.開發氫氣來源：短中期以海外進口藍氫、綠氫為主，長期於我國再生能源供應量充足之前提下，逐步擴大自產綠氫。3.建設基礎設施：短期運用天然氣有設施，評估氫氣進口儲存設施建置地點，中長期則配合應用場域建構氫氣基礎設施。4.為具體推動上開發展策略，經濟部業成立氫能推動小組，以減碳為目標發展氫能技術及應用，原則每季召開1次工作小組會議。(三)又，本年舉行之全國性公投，為首次全國性公投單獨舉行投票，中選會已加強宣導投票日期、時間、投票時應注意事項及國民年滿18歲有公民投票權。另為使民眾充分瞭解本次全國性公投案內容及正、反方意見論述，該會除依法彙集公投案主文、理由書、政府機關意見書及其他投票有關規定等編印公投公報，並定於本年11月13日至12月11日於華視、民視、中視、臺視及公視舉辦全國性公投案意見發表會，每一公投案各舉辦5場，以供公投案正、反意見支持代表發表意見。","docUrl":"https://lci.ly.gov.tw/LyLCEW/communique1/work/111/34/LCIDC01_1113401_00006.doc","baseId":"aab3661f-0f4a-29bf-24d1-8c21517adbdc","isChunked":true,"chunkIndex":1,"totalChunks":2,"chunkText":"（九）行政院函送羅委員明才就第10屆第4會期施政質詢之書面答復，請查照案。\n\n升整體體質及永續競爭力，期發揮提高育成率、降低生產成本、強化外銷佈局及完善產業鏈加值等實質效益，在面對貿易高度自由化之挑戰下，捍衛國產豬肉9成之自給率。(二)另有關所提經濟部應投入氫能技術發展部分，現行我國氫能發展推動策略規劃如下：1.發展氫能應用：(1)短中期以能源部門及工業用氫（產業）低碳化應用為主，並採國際合作或直接引進相關應用技術。(2)台電公司：短期以混氫燃氣發電性能研析，中長期以全氫能電廠設置方向推動。(3)中鋼公司：短期以「鋼化聯產」煉鋼製程副產氫轉為合成燃料，中長期以焦炭混氫降低煉鋼製程碳排放，導入純「氫能煉鋼」。2.開發氫氣來源：短中期以海外進口藍氫、綠氫為主，長期於我國再生能源供應量充足之前提下，逐步擴大自產綠氫。3.建設基礎設施：短期運用天然氣有設施，評估氫氣進口儲存設施建置地點，中長期則配合應用場域建構氫氣基礎設施。4.為具體推動上開發展策略，經濟部業成立氫能推動小組，以減碳為目標發展氫能技術及應用，原則每季召開1次工作小組會議。(三)又，本年舉行之全國性公投，為首次全國性公投單獨舉行投票，中選會已加強宣導投票日期、時間、投票時應注意事項及國民年滿18歲有公民投票權。另為使民眾充分瞭解本次全國性公投案內容及正、反方意見論述，該會除依法彙集公投案主文、理由書、政府機關意見書及其他投票有關規定等編印公投公報，並定於本年11月13日至12月11日於華視、民視、中視、臺視及公視舉辦全國性公投案意見發表會，每一公投案各舉辦5場，以供公投案正、反意見支持代表發表意見。"}}

備效率，以減少用電量，俾降低對營運成本之衝擊。(2)為減少用電戶繳交碳費，台電公司將積極降低電力排碳係數，以減少每度電之排碳量，並期待在電力供應端與需求端共同努力下，達成國家減量目標。2.中油公司：(1)持續推動節能減碳計畫，並訂定煉化廠每年能源效率提升1.7%之目標，主要策略包含提高能源效率、加強能源管理、區域能資源互補、使用低碳能源等，以持續降低溫室氣體排放量。(2)目前行政院環保署徵收時間、對象、費率、計算方式等細節尚未明確，將持續追蹤修法內容及進度，並爭取合理收費制度。(3)根據世界銀行2020年報告，大部分徵收碳稅國家，其電力碳稅成本移轉於電價。現行油價計算已將空污費納入，未來碳費之徵收，仍建議回歸使用者付費精神，透過油價公式反應成本。3.中鋼公司：持續致力於提升能效，於既有製程開發減碳專案並予執行，同時蒐研國內外最新低碳技術並評估導入，使製程排碳量下降減少碳費，以減緩碳費徵收帶來之衝擊。(二)有關短、中、長期溫室氣體減量目標方面：1.台電公司：(1)短、中期目標：依據現行「溫室氣體減量及管理法」之溫室氣體階段管制目標減碳路徑，第二期（民國109年至114年）目標願景：114年較基準年（94年）減10%；以台電系統94年溫室氣體排放量105百萬噸為基準，台電系統114年以95百萬噸排放量為目標（較基準年減10%），將以無碳再生能源及低碳燃氣電力為主要供電來源，並以氣代煤減少溫室氣體排放量。(2)長期目標：台電公司正積極關注新減碳技術進展，並滾動研擬減碳策略及技術發展藍圖，適時引進先進綠能發電技術、氨及氫能燃燒及碳捕捉封存等新技術，最終朝139年淨零排放為目標。主要透過「低碳能源替代高碳」、「碳捕集、儲存之固碳技術」，推動電網「綠電併網極大化」投入相關資源。2.中油公司：(1)短、中期目標：訂定114年及119年排放量較94年分別減量40.6%及49.5%之目標，並持續進行滾動檢討。(2)長期目標：將持續依技術成熟度發展並導入再生能源、氫能、碳捕捉封存再利用等負碳技術，以139年達成碳中和為長期努力目標，以因應國際淨零趨勢。3.中鋼公司：(1)短期目標：114年較107年減排7%，以「能效提升」為主軸，至110年10月已執行「停止燃煤發電」，並規劃「新一二階煉焦爐增設乾式淬火設備」、「高爐降低燃料率，以及智能化操作」、「增用廢鋼」等計314項減碳行動方案。(2)中期目標：119年較107年減排22%，以鋼化聯產、高爐噴吹富氫氣體、添加HBI取代部分鐵礦，將現有高爐轉型為低碳高爐。另匯集成大、台大、清大等10所學、研機構18位學者專家，成立氫能冶金研究中心，針對中程減碳方案合作投入基礎研究。(3)長期目標：以139年達成碳中和為努力目標，規劃「無碳高爐」與「氫直接還原」為長期邁向碳中和之二大策略。四、關於碳定價必要性與歐盟碳邊境調整機制對國內產業出口影響評估問題：(一)有關有效碳定價之必要性方面：1.「國際貨幣基金組織」（IMF）、「經濟合作暨發展組織」（OECD）、「世界銀行」（WB）等國際機構指出減少碳排最佳方法是對碳徵收價格，認為碳定價係有效因應氣候變遷之減碳工具。目前全球共有60餘種碳定價機制，歐盟、美國等亦將針對進口品課徵碳關稅，以防範碳洩漏風險，並確保其國內企業產業競爭力。2.我國推動碳定價做法初期以碳費先行，以激勵企業自願減碳：(1)目前國際間碳定價主要方式為徵收碳稅費或實施總量管制及排放交易機制（Emission Trading Schemes，ETS）等二類。考量我國碳市場規模小、排放源集中、流動性不足等問題，推動排放交易制度須先有完善配套機制設計，避免像韓國因排放源集中致使碳價波動劇烈等問題發生，因此行政院環保署規劃以碳費先行之模式實施我國碳定價制度。(2)行政院環保署刻正辦理「溫室氣體減量及管理法」修法作業，透過新增徵收碳費規定，並分階段擴大徵收對象，初期以大排放源（年排放2.5萬噸以上）為主，未來再逐漸擴大至中小型製造業與一定規模以上商業。若國內實施碳定價，將有助企業進行清潔技術投資，採用低碳生產方式，降低產品碳足跡，以減少繳交碳關稅之稅額，減緩碳關稅對企業衝擊。碳費徵收所得則專款專用於減碳工作，並優先用於輔導、補助及獎勵事業投資溫室氣體減量技術、發展低碳技術及低碳產業，促進低碳經濟發展。有關碳費徵收對象、費率及獎勵補助等相關事項，將於子法訂定。(二)有關歐盟碳邊境調整機制對我國產業影響評估方面：1.歐盟碳邊境調整機制說明：(1)歐盟本年7月14日公布碳邊境調整機制（CBAM）草案，預計於2023年將針對進口鋼鐵、鋁、水泥、肥料及電力等5類碳洩漏風險高之產品，要求進口申報產品之碳排放量；至2026年正式實施後進口商須向歐盟購買憑證，繳交產品碳排放量之費用。(2)依據歐盟公布之草案內容，若出口商能向歐盟提出該產品已經在原產國支付碳成本之證明（該國已實施碳定價制度，如碳稅或排放交易），可獲得費用減免優惠。2.對我國產業出口影響評估：根據經濟部評估，歐盟CBAM管制項目有248項，其中我國輸歐盟共有128項，總金額約245億元，占臺灣出口歐盟總金額之3.6%，主要以鋼鐵製品為主。目前我國每噸粗鋼耗能15.61GJ，低於世界平均（19.84GJ），短期仍具競爭力。因此，歐盟實施CBAM短期對我國影響應屬有限，惟除歐盟外，美國、日本等國亦表示未來可能會針對進口產品徵收碳關稅，國際間採取貿易政策，以因應碳洩漏風險之手段已儼然成形。未來對我國產業影響仍需密切關注。3.面對歐盟實施碳邊境調整機制與國際碳關稅未來趨勢：政府將密切關注國際減碳措施發展，並與國內相關產業等利害關係人進行溝通及討論，提出適宜我國之因應作法，協助國內產業做好準備。同時，政府將持續推動節能減碳、碳足跡相關產業輔導以多面向協助企業，維持並提升企業之國際競爭力。","docUrl":"https://lci.ly.gov.tw/LyLCEW/communique1/work/111/34/LCIDC01_1113401_00006.doc","baseId":"aa6a9db8-915a-a088-6aee-52e79c077f7e","isChunked":false,"chunkIndex":null,"totalChunks":null,"chunkText":"（十）行政院函送吳委員怡玎就第10屆第4會期施政質詢之書面答復，請查照案。\n\n吳委員就有關提供「產業創新條例」修正草案投資抵減之稅式支出報告等問題所提質詢，經交據有關機關查復如下：一、關於提供「產業創新條例」修正草案投資抵減之稅式支出報告問題：「產業創新條例」第10條之1修正草案，已於本（110）年11月25日經行政院院會通過，本年11月26日函送貴院審議，其稅式支出評估報告經濟部已於本年10月8日函送財政部，仍在複評中，俟複評通過，將儘速函送相關資料予貴院財政委員會、經濟委員會及吳委員辦公室。二、關於提供「生技新藥產業發展條例」修正草案投資抵減之稅式支出報告問題：經濟部已於本年4月1日將「生技新藥產業發展條例」修正草案有關投資抵減之稅式支出報告函送財政部，財政部於本年6月2日函復並無不同意見。經濟部於本年10月1日將「生技新藥產業發展條例修正草案租稅優惠稅式評估報告」函送貴院經濟委員會、社會福利及衛生環境委員會、財政委員會等。三、關於台電、中油、中鋼等公營事業之碳費徵收因應措施及短、中、長期溫室氣體減量目標問題：(一)有關碳費徵收因應措施方面：1.台電公司：(1)「溫室氣體減量及管理法」修正草案對電力業徵收碳費之範疇主要為火力電廠之廠內用電；台電公司將致力於提升廠內設備效率，以減少用電量，俾降低對營運成本之衝擊。(2)為減少用電戶繳交碳費，台電公司將積極降低電力排碳係數，以減少每度電之排碳量，並期待在電力供應端與需求端共同努力下，達成國家減量目標。2.中油公司：(1)持續推動節能減碳計畫，並訂定煉化廠每年能源效率提升1.7%之目標，主要策略包含提高能源效率、加強能源管理、區域能資源互補、使用低碳能源等，以持續降低溫室氣體排放量。(2)目前行政院環保署徵收時間、對象、費率、計算方式等細節尚未明確，將持續追蹤修法內容及進度，並爭取合理收費制度。(3)根據世界銀行2020年報告，大部分徵收碳稅國家，其電力碳稅成本移轉於電價。現行油價計算已將空污費納入，未來碳費之徵收，仍建議回歸使用者付費精神，透過油價公式反應成本。3.中鋼公司：持續致力於提升能效，於既有製程開發減碳專案並予執行，同時蒐研國內外最新低碳技術並評估導入，使製程排碳量下降減少碳費，以減緩碳費徵收帶來之衝擊。(二)有關短、中、長期溫室氣體減量目標方面：1.台電公司：(1)短、中期目標：依據現行「溫室氣體減量及管理法」之溫室氣體階段管制目標減碳路徑，第二期（民國109年至114年）目標願景：114年較基準年（94年）減10%；以台電系統94年溫室氣體排放量105百萬噸為基準，台電系統114年以95百萬噸排放量為目標（較基準年減10%），將以無碳再生能源及低碳燃氣電力為主要供電來源，並以氣代煤減少溫室氣體排放量。(2)長期目標：台電公司正積極關注新減碳技術進展，並滾動研擬減碳策略及技術發展藍圖，適時引進先進綠能發電技術、氨及氫能燃燒及碳捕捉封存等新技術，最終朝139年淨零排放為目標。主要透過「低碳能源替代高碳」、「碳捕集、儲存之固碳技術」，推動電網「綠電併網極大化」投入相關資源。2.中油公司：(1)短、中期目標：訂定114年及119年排放量較94年分別減量40.6%及49.5%之目標，並持續進行滾動檢討。(2)長期目標：將持續依技術成熟度發展並導入再生能源、氫能、碳捕捉封存再利用等負碳技術，以139年達成碳中和為長期努力目標，以因應國際淨零趨勢。3.中鋼公司：(1)短期目標：114年較107年減排7%，以「能效提升」為主軸，至110年10月已執行「停止燃煤發電」，並規劃「新一二階煉焦爐增設乾式淬火設備」、「高爐降低燃料率，以及智能化操作」、「增用廢鋼」等計314項減碳行動方案。(2)中期目標：119年較107年減排22%，以鋼化聯產、高爐噴吹富氫氣體、添加HBI取代部分鐵礦，將現有高爐轉型為低碳高爐。另匯集成大、台大、清大等10所學、研機構18位學者專家，成立氫能冶金研究中心，針對中程減碳方案合作投入基礎研究。(3)長期目標：以139年達成碳中和為努力目標，規劃「無碳高爐」與「氫直接還原」為長期邁向碳中和之二大策略。四、關於碳定價必要性與歐盟碳邊境調整機制對國內產業出口影響評估問題：(一)有關有效碳定價之必要性方面：1.「國際貨幣基金組織」（IMF）、「經濟合作暨發展組織」（OECD）、「世界銀行」（WB）等國際機構指出減少碳排最佳方法是對碳徵收價格，認為碳定價係有效因應氣候變遷之減碳工具。目前全球共有60餘種碳定價機制，歐盟、美國等亦將針對進口品課徵碳關稅，以防範碳洩漏風險，並確保其國內企業產業競爭力。2.我國推動碳定價做法初期以碳費先行，以激勵企業自願減碳：(1)目前國際間碳定價主要方式為徵收碳稅費或實施總量管制及排放交易機制（Emission
